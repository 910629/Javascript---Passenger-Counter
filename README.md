# **Javascript - Passenger-Counter**

Jarache Khunyeli first ever Javascript project written in Javascript, HTML and CSS.
It is a tool that can be used to calculate the total number of people who entered a train/bus/plane station or even the number of passengers who boarded/disembarked the train/bus/plane.

## Availability

The passenger counter application is available at [Git Pages - Passenger Counter](https://910629.github.io/Javascript---Passenger-Counter/)
It is also available at [Netlify - Passenger Counter](https://jspassengercounter.netlify.app/)

## Usage

 * Increment Button: Each time you want to add 1 to the current tally, just click on the _increment button_.
 * Save Button: Each time you feel the need to save the current tally and begin a new one, just click on the _Save_ button.
 * Previous Entries: This shows you the list of _saved_ tallies. i.e. What the tally was each time you clicked on _Save_.
 * Total Passengers: This shows a total of all the tallies summed up, and increases by the latest tally amount each time you click on _Save_. That way you can see the current total passengers at any given time, should you need it.

## Credits

 * This Javascript project was written by Jarache Khunyeli with some guidance/lessons from scrimba.
 * A huge token of gratitude to [Scrimba](scrimba.com) for the comprehensive, interactive lessons they provided.
